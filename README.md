# **Project 10: CineFlex**

The goal with this website was to get a better idea of ​​how we can change what the user will see without actually changing the page, just simulating with a SPA. For that we created a movie seat booking website, where we could see the available sessions and hours. We could explore the react router and practice even more how to make information available to the components that need it.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-   React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
-   React Router (useNavigate, useParams, useLocation)
-   Styled components (keyframes, GlobalStyles)
-   API integration

## **Results**:

I first built the whole project without using the useEffect hook. So when I implemented it, it was amazing how much simpler my project became, without so many states to manage, and also made simple to create a loading page to the hole project. Also, the useParams and useLocation, helped me to reduce the number of variables I was using.
